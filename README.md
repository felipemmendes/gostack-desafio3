## Features

To complete this challenge, I needed to add the following funcionalities to the app, and pass all tests.

* ``List repositories``: Should list all repositories from an API response.
* ``Add a new repository``: Should request the creation of a new repository in the API and reflect API changes on the page.
* ``Remove a repository``: Every item must have a remove button that should request the deletion of that item from the API and reflect API changes on the page.

## This project uses

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
